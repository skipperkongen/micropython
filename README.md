# Getting started with Micro Python on a Raspberry Pico W

I'll be using a Raspberry Pi Pico W, a micro USB cable, an Intel Mac Book Pro and Visual Studio Code (assumed to be installed).

- Install micro python using [instructions](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/micropython.html) on raspberrypi.com
- Follow directions by [Kevin on Youtube](https://youtu.be/x4nE1o5JsSg). He takes a bit long because he explains many irrelevant things, but it works.
