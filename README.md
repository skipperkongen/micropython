# Getting started with Micro Python on a Raspberry Pico W

I'll be using a Raspberry Pi Pico W, a micro USB cable, an Intel Mac Book Pro and Visual Studio Code (assumed to be installed), and 
the [Pico-W-Go extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=paulober.pico-w-go) for VS Code.

- Install micro python on Pico using [instructions on raspberrypi.com](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/micropython.html).
- Install [Pico-W-Go extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=paulober.pico-w-go) for VS Code.
